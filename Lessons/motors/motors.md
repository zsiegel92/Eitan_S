## What is a motor?

[What is a motor](http://blog.first4magnets.com/what-is-a-homopolar-motor-and-how-does-one-work/)?

>"An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy.[1][2] Heat engines burn a fuel to create heat which is then used to do work. Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion; pneumatic motors use compressed air; and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy. In biological systems, molecular motors, like myosins in muscles, use chemical energy to create forces and eventually motion." -[Wikipedia (Engine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine)

An engine converts **energy** into **mechanical energy**. What is energy? Energy is the ability to do work; work is the ability to accelerate matter; acceleration is changing speed; all objects are made of matter; speed is a measurement of how much an object's position changes. **So, energy can be thought of as the ability to move objects.**

Gasoline and other natural fuels store a lot of energy, and, sure enough, lighting a match next to gasoline will trigger the release of much of that energy ([BOOM!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL9jnVrM69M)).

### Earth is just a rock floating around in space. Why does anything on Earth have energy?

The Earth is made of exploded stars. When those stars exploded, they were quite hot, and at first Earth was a hot ball of magma floating in space.

Space is very cold. Over time, Earth cooled and a crust formed on its surface, like the surface of a lake freezing out in the cold. That's what we're walking on; underneath us, Earth's core is still magma.

Floating alone in cold space, though, Earth would eventually cool and fully freeze into a solid, like a cube of water freezing into an ice cube in the freezer. Nearby Earth, though, is *the Sun*. The Sun is very hot, and heats Earth. The Sun keeps Earth warm enough for the center to still be magma.

From the definition of engines above, we see that "Heat...is then used to do work." But we engines don't usually use only the warmth of the planet to create mechanical energy.

#### How did energy get stored in oil and gas underground?

Life on Earth needs energy to survive. Most life doesn't get its energy by absorbing the warmth of Earth. Most life absorbs energy by eating other living things. But that energy has to come from *somewhere*, and the bottom of the *food chain* is plants, which absorb energy from the Sun!

	Most organisms eat other organisms to obtain energy. At the very bottom of the food web, we see *phytoplankton* and *vegetation*. These are living things that absorb sunlight to obtain energy.

As dead organisms sink under dirt and underwater, some of the energy contained in their flesh pools together. At the high pressure underground, that energetic flesh gets smooshed together into matter that contains energy, like coal and oil. That's why those things contain so much energy.

## Electric Motors

Just like chemical energy gets released when we heat gasoline, electrical energy is released when we create a *conducting path* between areas with different amounts of electric potential. A rock will fall off a cliff if it's given the chance, converting its height into mechanical energy; in the same way, electrons will flow from areas abundant in electrons to areas with fewer electrons when given the chance.

### Why does electricity flowing near a magnet cause motion?

Electrons that are flowing cause a magnetic field.

Just like magnets repel and attract each other, the magnetic force created by electricity flowing interacts with magnets and creates force. This can be harnessed to move matter!
