## Wikis

### What is a *wiki*?!

You have used the following types of *resources*:

* Article
* Novel
* Newspaper
* Magazine
* Essay

A **wiki** is just another informational resource:

* wi·ki<br>
	ˈwikē<br>
	noun<br>
	A website that allows collaborative editing of its content and structure by its users.

A wiki *always* contains information on different *pages*, each of which are like a short article. A core feature of a wiki is the ability to navigate from page to page using links.

## Assignments

Make a wiki of your own!

It can be on any topic, but it must satisfy the following requirements:

* Each page must **link** to at least one other page of the wiki (using `<a href="some_url">link title</a>`)
* *Each page must **link** back to the homepage*!
* At least two **images** must be embedded somewhere in the wiki (using `<img src="some_image_url"/>`)
* Some HTML **style** attribute must be controlled (`style="background:#e7e9b1; color:#301f1f;"`, for example)
